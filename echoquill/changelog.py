============================================================
ECHOQUILL PRO
============================================================

v2.20.5  (2026-07-16)
    Fixed the presets/sets windows. Buttons no longer get cut off - Add, Edit, Delete, Done (and Save set) are pinned to the bottom of the window and always visible, no matter the size. The questions list now has real vertical AND horizontal scrollbars. And you can HOVER any question - in both the questions list and the set checklist - to read the full text in a popup. Everything fits inside the window without resizing it.

v2.20.4  (2026-07-16)
    Split the presets UI so nothing is crowded. The "Presets" button by the transcriber now opens JUST your questions (add / edit / delete) - the same simple screen as elsewhere. "Manage sets" in Auto-batch opens JUST the sets: tick questions, type a name, and "Save set" sits right next to the name box. A small "Add/edit questions" link is on the sets window too. Two small single-purpose windows instead of one busy combined one.

v2.20.3  (2026-07-16)
    Rebuilt the presets manager to be dead simple, in two clearly separated sections. TOP - "Your questions": your master list. Type a question, click "Add question" - done. Edit or delete the ones you added. BOTTOM - "Question sets (optional)": tick questions, type a set name, click "Save set". No more mixing up "add a question to the list" with "build a set" - each has its own obvious button.

v2.20.2  (2026-07-16)
    Presets: you can ADD a new question directly inside the Presets & Sets manager - a dedicated "Add a new question" box (Ctrl+Enter or the Add button), and the button is now clearly labeled "Add / edit questions…". Adding works in every presets area now, not just editing.

v2.20.1  (2026-07-16)
    Reliability + feedback. (1) Downloads (URL transcribe, save video/audio, Auto-batch) now show LIVE progress - percent and speed - in the status line, instead of sitting silent. (2) A 30-second network timeout means a stalled download (e.g. a Vimeo link that won't respond) now fails with a clear message instead of hanging forever with no sign of life. (3) If a transcription is cancelled or errors - or you close the transcriber window - its Whisper model is unloaded and memory is reclaimed, so an aborted or stuck job can no longer leave RAM tied up and drag the whole app down.

v2.20.0  (2026-07-16)
    Reach your Ask-AI presets and question SETS without transcribing a video first. (1) New "⚙ Presets" button next to the ? in Transcribe video/audio. (2) New "⚙ Manage sets…" button in Auto-batch, next to the Question set dropdown. Both open a standalone manager where you add/edit your questions AND build, load, edit, or delete named sets (the sets Auto-batch runs) - so you can tweak your batch questions any time, between runs.

v2.19.6  (2026-07-16)
    Auto-batch "Clear all" now resets all three areas in one click: the one-line-per-video list at the top, the Question set dropdown (back to none), and the progress log at the bottom.

v2.19.5  (2026-07-16)
    Auto-batch: added a "Clear all" button that wipes both the URL list and the progress log in one click, so you can line up and run another batch without closing the window or stopping anything.

v2.19.4  (2026-07-16)
    Window behavior. (1) The column builder ("Build your list") now closes automatically when you press Start - nothing left open behind you; the list is already carried into Auto-batch. (2) "Auto-batch + Ask AI" and the column builder now open IN FRONT of the transcriber instead of behind it (brought to the front and focused on open).

v2.19.3  (2026-07-16)
    Column builder / Auto-batch fixes. (1) Start no longer requires saving first - that gate is removed (a stray auto-event was also silently un-marking the save, which is why Start seemed dead even after you saved). (2) Start now reliably carries the list over: it fills the Auto-batch box, brings that window to the front, and starts the run (pick a question set there first if you haven't). (3) Added a "Load .xlsx" button on the Auto-batch window itself, so you can upload a saved list straight into it - no need to go through the column builder.

v2.19.2  (2026-07-16)
    Column builder polish. (1) Pasted columns now count INSTANTLY - the URL/Title/Folder counts update the moment you paste, no keystroke needed (switched to the text box's own change event). (2) Auto-normalizer cleans Title and Folder names (never the URL): a colon becomes " -", parentheses are dropped, and characters that break Windows files/folders (/ \ * ? " < > |) become "-", applied to each folder level. It runs automatically on Save/Start, and the cleaned values fill back into the boxes so what you see is exactly what gets saved and used.

v2.19.1  (2026-07-16)
    Rebuilt the Auto-batch column builder the way it should work: THREE tall paste boxes side by side - URLs, Titles, Folders - each with its own horizontal AND vertical scrollbar. Paste a whole column at once (10 URLs, then 10 titles, then 10 folders); line N of each box lines up as video N. Live counts under the boxes flag if a column is uneven. A small ✕ clears one column; "Clear all" wipes everything. Separate "Save" (writes the .xlsx backup) and "Start" (still gated - only after a save). Same window size as Auto-batch.

v2.19.0  (2026-07-16)
    Auto-batch upgrades. (1) New "Build from columns" button (top-right of Auto-batch) opens a bigger pop-up with an editable 3-column grid - URL, Title, Folder - that scrolls both ways so you can check long URLs and lots of rows. Paste three columns straight out of Excel/Sheets to fill it instantly. Save (pick a folder and type a name - no extension needed) writes a real .xlsx backup AND loads the rows into Auto-batch ready to Start; "Load .xlsx" reopens a saved list to re-run. (2) Memory: after each video and after the question loop the finished transcript/audio are dropped and garbage-collected, and the Whisper model is unloaded when the whole batch finishes - lighter RAM with no speed cost.

v2.18.0  (2026-07-16)
    AI providers leveled up. (1) New "OpenAI Codex (subscription)" provider - use GPT-5.5 on your ChatGPT plan with NO API key, through the local Codex CLI (install Codex and run "codex login" once; works on this PC only). (2) OpenRouter added as a first-class provider - one key, hundreds of models. (3) "Refresh" button pulls the provider's live model list straight into the dropdown, so you never type a model name. (4) "Test" button fires one tiny call and shows a check or the exact error - for any provider, Codex included.

v2.17.0  (2026-07-16)
    Auto-batch + Ask AI (new). Paste a block of videos, one per line as "URL | Title | folder\subfolder" (title and folder optional; blank title uses the video's own title). For each video in turn, EchoQuill downloads and SAVES the video and the audio, transcribes and saves the transcript, then runs one of your saved question SETS against that video and saves the answers as a "<name> - Q&A.txt" - all into that line's folder, created as deep as you type (each backslash = a nested level). Live progress line + Stop button; each video's answers come only from its own transcript. Opens from the new "Auto-batch + Ask AI..." button next to Batch in the video transcriber.

v2.16.3  (2026-07-16)
    Save dialogs now default to the correct folder. Transcript "Save as .txt" opens in your Transcriptions folder, pre-filled with the video's title; Export and Export-audio default to your EchoQuill folder. (Meeting and Read-aloud saves already did.) Verified every "Open folder" button opens its own feature's folder.

v2.16.2  (2026-07-16)
    Meeting tab gets the same power presets as the video Ask AI: an "Ask several..." batch dialog - tick multiple preset questions, run them in a row, each answer drops into the recording box. Save a checked group as a named SET and reload it anytime.

v2.16.1  (2026-07-16)
    FIX - installers were not publishing. The CI "create release" step got a 404 (the workflow token could not create releases). Added contents:write permission + an explicit token so releases publish and the in-app updater sees new versions again.

v2.16.0  (2026-07-16)
    Ask AI power presets (video transcriber): (1) "Auto-save answers" checkbox (default on). (2) "Ask several..." batch dialog - tick multiple preset questions and run them in a row, each saved to the Q&A file. (3) Saved question SETS - save a checked group as a named set and reload it anytime.

v2.15.10  (2026-07-16)
    Ask-AI preset manager: Add and Edit now use a wide multi-line block box (was a cramped field). Applies to the video transcriber Ask AI and Meeting presets.

v2.15.9  (2026-07-16)
    Left-menu scrollbar is now a SMALL fixed ~40px blue thumb that slides as you scroll. Draggable, always visible.

v2.15.8  (2026-07-16)
    Left menu now has an ALWAYS-visible blue scrollbar (no more auto-hide). Any mode.

v2.15.7  (2026-07-16)
    All scrollbars now accent-blue (light + dark); right-click pill menu dismisses on click-away; phone-share token lengthened.

v2.15.0  (2026-07-16)
    Settings cleanup + What's New. Scroll panes auto-hide when content fits (no more pointless bars on Stats/License/About); the text-box sections (Transcription, History, Help, Feedback, Dictionary) drop the outer pane so only the box's own scrollbar shows - no more double bars. Help updated with Meeting, Read aloud & phone. New 'What's New' section shows the full changelog (Pro + Free) in a scrollable box; CHANGELOG.md added.

v2.14.2  (2026-07-16)
    FIX - the standalone Read-aloud window was missing the '🎙 Convert to audio' button (its layout had reverted in an earlier reset while the instructions still referenced it). Restored: 'Load a document' + 'Convert to audio' sit together above the text box, matching the Settings section.

v2.14.1  (2026-07-16)
    (1) Read-aloud clarity - plain 1-2-3 instructions, 'Open a document' -> 'Load a document', 'Text to convert to audio' label, clearer tooltips. (2) Recent transcriptions now work like the Clips tray: drag a line onto any text box to drop it, or click to paste into your last app.

v2.14.0  (2026-07-15)
    'Listen on my phone' - a button in Read-aloud shows a QR code; scan it on a phone on the same WiFi to open a little page listing your narrations (stream or download). Local-network only, random-token URL, Range/seek streaming, no accounts, no cloud, no matching logins needed.

v2.13.5  (2026-07-15)
    fix double scrollbar in Meeting and Read-aloud - those sections no longer sit inside an outer scroll pane, so the transcript box's own internal scrollbar is the only one (matches the standalone windows).

v2.13.4  (2026-07-15)
    Read-aloud layout - 'Open a document' and 'Convert to audio' now sit together right above the text (natural open->convert flow); Voice + Load voices on their own row. Window width unchanged.

v2.13.3  (2026-07-15)
    'Save narrations to...' - point Read-aloud at any folder (e.g. a OneDrive/Drive/Dropbox synced folder) so MP3s appear on your phone automatically. Becomes the default; 'Use default' disconnects back to Documents/EchoQuill/Narration. In both the window and Settings.

v2.13.2  (2026-07-15)
    Read-aloud gets a clear '🎙 Convert to audio' button (Play no longer secretly generates) + the 2.13.1 fixes (unique temp file per render; right-click menu parented to the clicked field).

v2.13.1  (2026-07-15)
    fix two Read-aloud bugs - (1) 'Permission denied ...readaloud.wav' on a 2nd transcript: each render now writes a unique temp file and the player deletes the previous one (the open file was locked). (2) crash-log 'bad window path name' on right-click: the Cut/Copy/Paste menu is now parented to the field you clicked instead of a possibly-closed window.

v2.13.0  (2026-07-15)
    Read-aloud audio player - Play/Pause, Stop, and a seekable timeline you can drag to scrub/relisten. Built on Windows MCI (ctypes/winmm) - no new deps, no ffmpeg. Audio is generated once (one charge); pause/seek/replay are free. In both the window and the Settings section.

v2.12.6  (2026-07-15)
    scrollbars app-wide - one clean piece (no arrow buttons), medium-gray auto-sizing thumb that's visible on light AND dark (was white/invisible in light mode), accent colour while dragging.

v2.12.5  (2026-07-15)
    Read-aloud cost guard - live character counter + a 'this is N characters (~N ElevenLabs credits), generate anyway?' confirmation before any generation over 5k chars, in both the window and the Settings section. Stops surprise credit burns.

v2.12.4  (2026-07-15)
    CRITICAL - make the event loop unkillable. _poll only caught queue.Empty, so ANY exception in a window/handler killed the whole loop (dictation + every menu action dead, pill still visible). Now each event is isolated; crashes are logged to crash.log and the app keeps running. Adds tk report_callback_exception logging.

v2.12.3  (2026-07-15)
    FIX blank Settings panel - _build_read_aloud used helptip without importing it (NameError aborted the whole section build). Add scripts/check_undefined.py (pyflakes) + CI guard so a missing import can never blank a panel again.

v2.12.2  (2026-07-15)
    fix Read-aloud playback/save - drop ffmpeg entirely (raw PCM -> winsound for Play, direct MP3 concat for Save); every failure now pops a dialog and writes tts_error.log. This fixes 'made N chunks then nothing happened'.

v2.12.1  (2026-07-15)
    add 'Read aloud' as its own section in the Settings sidebar (next to Meeting), in addition to the existing tray + overlay shortcuts

v2.12.0  (2026-07-15)
    Read aloud (Text-to-speech) - paste text or open a .txt/.md/.docx/.pdf, pick an ElevenLabs voice, Play or Save as MP3 into Documents/EchoQuill/Narration. Pro, bring-your-own ElevenLabs key (kept in Credential Manager). Menu entries in tray + overlay.

v2.11.0  (2026-07-15)
    delete folders + folder controls in the edit dialog (add/remove/delete, migrates on save); preset dropdowns show full text on hover + Meeting menu truncated to compact width; copy/paste + right-click fixed in all fields (direct clipboard handlers, selection captured before menu opens)

v2.10.0  (2026-07-14)
    Ask AI re-binds to current video (fix cross-video mix-up); folders in Clips + Recent (custom 30-char dialog); Clips folder + Save/Open; standardized button bars; Meeting preset word-wrap + pinned Ask

v2.9.3  (2026-07-14)
    Ask AI about this video now reads the video's title + URL + full transcript (not the description). Answers plainly with only what's present - no 'not found'/negative filler, no invented links. Plus: saved Q&A blocks are separated by two rows of 50 asterisks.

v2.9.2  (2026-07-14)
    Approved batch: fix Ollama Cloud model list (kimi-k2.7 -> kimi-k2.7-code, verified against ollama.com; default -> qwen3.5), raise AI timeout 45->180s (gpt-oss:120b/thinking models were timing out). Ask AI presets: manager moved to the BOTTOM of the dropdown (add/edit/delete your own; defaults locked). Add Clear + Open-folder to 'Ask AI about this video'. Real always-visible right-side scrollbar on every text box (safe wrapper, no freeze).

v2.9.1  (2026-07-14)
    Revert the self-updating yt-dlp engine (2.8.0). Evidence: the YouTube download code is byte-identical to the last known-good version, so the only thing that changed was the engine version. The auto-updater force-swapped the bundled yt-dlp for the newest (most locked-down) copy on every launch. Back to the bundled engine; removed the Update-engine/Restart UI. Cookies paste box kept.

v2.9.0  (2026-07-14)
    Quality pass (2.9.0): verified every UI button/handler is wired (whole-app static scan, now enforced in CI so a broken build can't publish). Confirmed Ollama Cloud (ollama.com/api, gpt-oss:20b), Meeting Ask-AI presets, and Clips folders are all correctly hooked up. Restart button + simplified single sign-in retained. No new features - correctness + coherence.

v2.8.3  (2026-07-14)
    Clarify cookies: use the extension's 'Export All Cookies' so ONE file covers every logged-in site (YouTube AND Skool), since they use different cookies. v2.8.3

v2.8.2  (2026-07-14)
    Add a real Restart button after engine updates (shows only when a restart is needed; app relaunches itself). Simplify Transcription: one sign-in method (paste cookies, covers YouTube+Skool+member-only) instead of two overlapping ones. Clarify that the 'do not edit' header in cookies is normal. v2.8.2

v2.8.1  (2026-07-14)
    Fix right-click Cut/Copy/Paste: menu now calls grab_release (it was flashing shut on Windows) and focuses the field so Paste lands there. Also bind middle-click. Right-click paste works in all text fields now. v2.8.1

v2.8.0  (2026-07-14)
    Self-updating video engine: EchoQuill now pulls the latest yt-dlp (pure-python wheel) into AppData and uses it, auto-refreshing on launch + an 'Update engine now' button — so YouTube changes stop breaking downloads. Redo YouTube cookies as a paste box with Save/Clear (paste exported cookies straight in). v2.8.0

v2.7.7  (2026-07-14)
    YouTube auth: Chrome locks/encrypts its cookie DB (yt-dlp #7271). Add a Cookies file (cookies.txt) option in Settings > Transcription (most reliable, works around Chrome), prefer it over browser cookies, and give a plain-language error pointing to Firefox or a cookies.txt. v2.7.7

v2.7.6  (2026-07-14)
    YouTube 'confirm you're not a bot' errors now show plain guidance in the transcriber + batch: turn on Settings > Transcription > Sign in via browser. (This is YouTube's anti-bot escalation; cookies-from-browser is the fix and is already supported.) v2.7.6

v2.7.5  (2026-07-14)
    CRITICAL: define _preset_add_current/_preset_remove_current (the +/trash buttons referenced them but they were never added). Their absence threw AttributeError while building the Meeting panel, blanking the entire Settings window from Meeting onward (incl. AI Enhancement). Settings renders fully again. v2.7.5

v2.7.4  (2026-07-14)
    Fix Ollama Cloud default model (was a non-Ollama 'gemini-3' id -> real gpt-oss:20b + catalog ids). Add +/trash inline preset save/remove to the video 'Ask AI about this video' (parity with Meeting). v2.7.4

v2.7.3  (2026-07-14)
    HOTFIX: revert the auto-scrollbar in dark_text — packing a scrollbar inside the yscrollcommand callback caused an infinite Tk geometry loop that froze the whole app (windows wouldn't open, menu/quit dead). Text boxes scroll via wheel again; will re-add visible scrollbars the safe wrapped way later. v2.7.3

v2.7.2  (2026-07-14)
    Clips vault (Pro): folders in the Favorites tab — a Folder filter + per-clip move-to-folder (type a name to create). Meeting: inline + save / trash-remove preset buttons instead of a separate manage dialog. v2.7.2

v2.7.1  (2026-07-14)
    Fix AI 404 with Ollama Cloud: ollama.com only serves the native /api/chat (not OpenAI /v1). New ai_call routes native for ollama.com and any /api base; OpenAI-compat otherwise. Ollama Cloud default + saved URLs migrated to https://ollama.com/api. Applies to dictation cleanup, Ask-AI and the editor. v2.7.1

v2.7.0  (2026-07-14)
    Tooltips: only one open at a time, always closes on leave (poll catches missed leaves). Real visible auto-scrollbars on every text box. Meeting: '?' help by the title, clearer 'Name this meeting/recording' label. Ask AI replaces Summarize in Meeting + preset-question dropdown (with add/remove your own) in both Meeting and the video transcriber. v2.7.0

v2.6.6  (2026-07-14)
    Perf + UX: Recent transcriptions now lazy/paged (only the visible page is parsed — snappy with thousands). Every text box scrolls internally (wheel scrolls the text, not the page) app-wide. v2.6.6

v2.6.5  (2026-07-14)
    Meeting tab overhaul: tooltips everywhere, Name required before Start, Save opens in Meetings folder, added Copy/Open-folder/Clear (parity with transcriber), fixed-height text box so action buttons are always visible + internal scrolling, temp-file cleanup after screen recording, add Clips subfolder. v2.6.5

v2.6.4  (2026-07-13)
    Meeting capture fix: init COM multithreaded (MTA) on the WASAPI thread and pick the loopback device robustly - fixes 'Nothing captured'. Clearer diagnostics (no-audio vs silence). v2.6.4

v2.6.3  (2026-07-13)
    Installer: per-user install (PrivilegesRequired=lowest) so silent auto-updates need no admin - fixes 'DeleteFile failed code 5 Access denied' in Program Files. Add Meeting/Record to the pill + tray menus. Make Meeting a Pro feature (free shows it locked with Upgrade to Pro). v2.6.3

v2.6.2  (2026-07-13)
    Fix Meeting recording error 0x800401F0 (CoInitialize the WASAPI capture thread). Organize output into one Documents/EchoQuill folder with subfolders (Transcriptions, Meetings); meeting transcripts + recordings save to Meetings. v2.6.2

v2.6.1  (2026-07-13)
    Meeting/Record: add 'Also capture the screen' — records desktop video (ffmpeg gdigrab) + system audio, muxes to MP4, and transcribes. Turns it into a full Zoom/Meet/webinar recorder, not just audio. Bundles ffmpeg via imageio-ffmpeg. v2.6.1

v2.6.0  (2026-07-13)
    New Meeting/Record tab: capture system audio (+ optional mic) and transcribe locally - works for calls, webinars, and any playing video incl. Skool (no URL). Adds AI 'Summarize' + save. Sidebar reordered: General, then services A-Z (incl. Meeting), then History/Stats, then License/Help/Feedback/About. v2.6.0

v2.5.8  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber layout: put Keep audio / Keep video checkboxes and Find in transcript on one row (fills the empty right side). v2.5.8

v2.5.7  (2026-07-13)
    Keep video file: now downloads the video FIRST (before the long transcription) so the signed Skool link is still valid, with visible status and a saved-file note. Uses a mergeless 'best' format so it works without extra ffmpeg steps. v2.5.7

v2.5.6  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber: optional 'Name this transcript' box. Leave blank for the video's own title; type a name and the transcript (and any kept audio/video) saves under it automatically - ideal for Skool videos that have no title. v2.5.6

v2.5.5  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber: add 'Keep audio file' and 'Keep video file' checkboxes (default OFF). Keeps the downloaded audio and/or downloads the full video into the transcripts folder, with Skool Referer + browser-cookies support. v2.5.5

v2.5.4  (2026-07-13)
    Skool support: auto-add Referer/Origin for skool.com and .m3u8 (signed HLS), plus optional 'Sign in via browser' (yt-dlp cookies-from-browser) for member-only videos. Settings > Transcription dropdown + help text. v2.5.4

v2.5.3  (2026-07-13)
    Update install now runs the installer via a hidden waiter that starts only AFTER EchoQuill has fully exited - fixes the green banner 'close all instances' / app-not-closing race. Fixes both the banner and the About button routes. v2.5.3

v2.5.2  (2026-07-13)
    Recent transcriptions: drop the static caption line, add a hover '?' help next to the title (consistent with the other windows). Real per-icon tooltips remain. v2.5.2

v2.5.1  (2026-07-13)
    Fix tooltips not showing inside scrolling lists (ignore the spurious mouse-leave when the tip window maps; delayed cursor-anchored tooltip). Add tooltips across all windows: transcriber, batch, Ask AI, recent-transcriptions paging/tabs/delete, clips tabs/close. v2.5.1

v2.5.0  (2026-07-13)
    Recent transcriptions now works like the Clips tray: per-row star/edit/delete icons, a Recent/Favorites tab (Favorite pulls up only favorites), real search box with placeholder, tooltips. Clips search bar redone the same way (placeholder, no bare emoji) + row tooltips. v2.5.0

v2.4.9  (2026-07-12)
    Editor: clean layout (Save/Cancel + Ask AI never overlap), the AI instruction is now an obvious bordered field with placeholder, visible status feedback, and a tooltip. Tooltips + clear hints on all Ask AI buttons. v2.4.9

v2.4.8  (2026-07-12)
    Fix update install loop: hard-exit on update (frees single-instance mutex + file locks instantly), relaunched copy waits out the stale lock, exit immediately when installer launches. v2.4.8

v2.4.7  (2026-07-12)
    Favorite is now a real toggle (click again to un-favorite). Help '?' is a hover tooltip next to the title (no click, no 'New here?'). v2.4.7

v2.4.6  (2026-07-12)
    Edit dialog: Save always visible, opens beside the tray, + Ask AI (rewrite/reformat/answer in place). Remove ping watchdog window; installer relaunches silently. v2.4.6

v2.4.5  (2026-07-12)
    In-app update banner + Install button in Settings; auto-check on every open; drop floating desktop badge. v2.4.5

v2.4.4  (2026-07-12)
    Recent transcriptions: fit buttons, double/right-click edit, right-click menu, ★ favorites. v2.4.4

v2.4.3  (2026-07-12)
    Fix update checker: point Pro at echoquill-pro repo (was reading free repo, so Pro never saw updates). v2.4.3

v2.4.2  (2026-07-12)
    Edit on the visible top toolbar (Newer/Older/page line); edit clips in the tray (✎)

v2.4.1  (2026-07-12)
    Edit button visible (moved left, wider window)

v2.4.0  (2026-07-12)
    '?' help icons on Clips, Transcriber, and Ask AI windows (how-to incl. drag/click paste + admin note)

v2.3.3  (2026-07-12)
    trigger public build (auto-update now fully one-click from GitHub)

v2.3.2  (2026-07-12)
    Pro auto-update identical to free (GitHub download+install) — one-click the moment the repo is public

v2.3.1  (2026-07-12)
    Pro updates point to GitHub (not Lemon Squeezy) — opens the Pro releases page to grab the installer

v2.3.0  (2026-07-12)
    auto update-check twice daily + green corner badge

v2.2.3  (2026-07-12)
    edit transcription text and save it (Recent transcriptions → Edit)

v2.2.2  (2026-07-09)

v2.1.4  (2026-07-09)
    Stop button on batch transcription too

v2.1.3  (2026-07-09)
    Stop button on the transcriber

v2.1.2  (2026-07-06)
    keys stored in Windows Credential Manager (survive updates); docs updated

v2.1.1  (2026-07-06)
    remove pointless 'Search the web instead' button from Ask AI

v2.1.0  (2026-07-06)
    Pro build unlocks all features unconditionally (no license limit until a store exists)

v2.0.9  (2026-07-06)
    separate engine per window (no freeze); Ask AI save-answer (title - question, appends, stays open); key strip; batch own engine one-at-a-time

v2.0.8  (2026-07-06)
    clearer checkbox label 'Format dictation with AI'

v2.0.7  (2026-07-06)

v2.0.0  (2026-07-06)
    EchoQuill Pro v2.0.0 — license activation, unlimited transcriptions, Favorites, unlimited clips, Ask AI with timestamps

============================================================
ECHOQUILL FREE
============================================================

v1.23.0  (2026-07-16)
    PARITY with Pro - brings Free up to date. NEW: Read aloud (Text-to-speech) with the audio player, Save-to-folder, and 'Listen on my phone' (QR over local WiFi). Reliability: crash-proof event loop + crash.log; copy/paste + right-click menu fix. UX: app-wide clean auto-hiding scrollbars (no more double/pointless bars); Recent transcriptions drag/click like the Clips tray. Help updated (Meeting, Read aloud & phone); new 'What's New' changelog section + CHANGELOG.md.

v1.22.0  (2026-07-15)
    delete folders + folder controls in the edit dialog; Meeting preset dropdown hover + truncate; copy/paste + right-click fixed in all fields

v1.21.0  (2026-07-14)
    folders in Clips + Recent (custom 30-char dialog); Clips folder + Save/Open; standardized button bars; Meeting preset word-wrap + pinned Ask

v1.20.2  (2026-07-14)
    Approved batch: fix Ollama Cloud model list (kimi-k2.7 -> kimi-k2.7-code, verified against ollama.com; default -> qwen3.5), raise AI timeout 45->180s (gpt-oss:120b/thinking models were timing out). Ask AI presets: manager moved to the BOTTOM of the dropdown (add/edit/delete your own; defaults locked). Add Clear + Open-folder to 'Ask AI about this video'. Real always-visible right-side scrollbar on every text box (safe wrapper, no freeze).

v1.20.1  (2026-07-14)
    Revert the self-updating yt-dlp engine (2.8.0). Evidence: the YouTube download code is byte-identical to the last known-good version, so the only thing that changed was the engine version. The auto-updater force-swapped the bundled yt-dlp for the newest (most locked-down) copy on every launch. Back to the bundled engine; removed the Update-engine/Restart UI. Cookies paste box kept.

v1.20.0  (2026-07-14)
    Quality pass (2.9.0): verified every UI button/handler is wired (whole-app static scan, now enforced in CI so a broken build can't publish). Confirmed Ollama Cloud (ollama.com/api, gpt-oss:20b), Meeting Ask-AI presets, and Clips folders are all correctly hooked up. Restart button + simplified single sign-in retained. No new features - correctness + coherence.

v1.19.3  (2026-07-14)
    Clarify cookies: use the extension's 'Export All Cookies' so ONE file covers every logged-in site (YouTube AND Skool), since they use different cookies. v1.19.3

v1.19.2  (2026-07-14)
    Add a real Restart button after engine updates (shows only when a restart is needed; app relaunches itself). Simplify Transcription: one sign-in method (paste cookies, covers YouTube+Skool+member-only) instead of two overlapping ones. Clarify that the 'do not edit' header in cookies is normal. v1.19.2

v1.19.1  (2026-07-14)
    Fix right-click Cut/Copy/Paste: menu now calls grab_release (it was flashing shut on Windows) and focuses the field so Paste lands there. Also bind middle-click. Right-click paste works in all text fields now. v1.19.1

v1.19.0  (2026-07-14)
    Self-updating video engine: EchoQuill now pulls the latest yt-dlp (pure-python wheel) into AppData and uses it, auto-refreshing on launch + an 'Update engine now' button — so YouTube changes stop breaking downloads. Redo YouTube cookies as a paste box with Save/Clear (paste exported cookies straight in). v1.19.0

v1.18.7  (2026-07-14)
    YouTube auth: Chrome locks/encrypts its cookie DB (yt-dlp #7271). Add a Cookies file (cookies.txt) option in Settings > Transcription (most reliable, works around Chrome), prefer it over browser cookies, and give a plain-language error pointing to Firefox or a cookies.txt. v1.18.7

v1.18.6  (2026-07-14)
    YouTube 'confirm you're not a bot' errors now show plain guidance in the transcriber + batch: turn on Settings > Transcription > Sign in via browser. (This is YouTube's anti-bot escalation; cookies-from-browser is the fix and is already supported.) v1.18.6

v1.18.5  (2026-07-14)
    CRITICAL: define _preset_add_current/_preset_remove_current (the +/trash buttons referenced them but they were never added). Their absence threw AttributeError while building the Meeting panel, blanking the entire Settings window from Meeting onward (incl. AI Enhancement). Settings renders fully again. v1.18.5

v1.18.4  (2026-07-14)
    Fix Ollama Cloud default model (was a non-Ollama 'gemini-3' id -> real gpt-oss:20b + catalog ids). Add +/trash inline preset save/remove to the video 'Ask AI about this video' (parity with Meeting). v1.18.4

v1.18.3  (2026-07-14)
    HOTFIX: revert the auto-scrollbar in dark_text — packing a scrollbar inside the yscrollcommand callback caused an infinite Tk geometry loop that froze the whole app (windows wouldn't open, menu/quit dead). Text boxes scroll via wheel again; will re-add visible scrollbars the safe wrapped way later. v1.18.3

v1.18.2  (2026-07-14)
    Clips vault (Pro): folders in the Favorites tab — a Folder filter + per-clip move-to-folder (type a name to create). Meeting: inline + save / trash-remove preset buttons instead of a separate manage dialog. v1.18.2

v1.18.1  (2026-07-14)
    Fix AI 404 with Ollama Cloud: ollama.com only serves the native /api/chat (not OpenAI /v1). New ai_call routes native for ollama.com and any /api base; OpenAI-compat otherwise. Ollama Cloud default + saved URLs migrated to https://ollama.com/api. Applies to dictation cleanup, Ask-AI and the editor. v1.18.1

v1.18.0  (2026-07-14)
    Tooltips: only one open at a time, always closes on leave (poll catches missed leaves). Real visible auto-scrollbars on every text box. Meeting: '?' help by the title, clearer 'Name this meeting/recording' label. Ask AI replaces Summarize in Meeting + preset-question dropdown (with add/remove your own) in both Meeting and the video transcriber. v1.18.0

v1.17.6  (2026-07-14)
    Perf + UX: Recent transcriptions now lazy/paged (only the visible page is parsed — snappy with thousands). Every text box scrolls internally (wheel scrolls the text, not the page) app-wide. v1.17.6

v1.17.5  (2026-07-14)
    Meeting tab overhaul: tooltips everywhere, Name required before Start, Save opens in Meetings folder, added Copy/Open-folder/Clear (parity with transcriber), fixed-height text box so action buttons are always visible + internal scrolling, temp-file cleanup after screen recording, add Clips subfolder. v1.17.5

v1.17.4  (2026-07-13)
    Meeting capture fix: init COM multithreaded (MTA) on the WASAPI thread and pick the loopback device robustly - fixes 'Nothing captured'. Clearer diagnostics (no-audio vs silence). v1.17.4

v1.17.3  (2026-07-13)
    Installer: per-user install (PrivilegesRequired=lowest) so silent auto-updates need no admin - fixes 'DeleteFile failed code 5 Access denied' in Program Files. Add Meeting/Record to the pill + tray menus. Make Meeting a Pro feature (free shows it locked with Upgrade to Pro). v1.17.3

v1.17.2  (2026-07-13)
    Fix Meeting recording error 0x800401F0 (CoInitialize the WASAPI capture thread). Organize output into one Documents/EchoQuill folder with subfolders (Transcriptions, Meetings); meeting transcripts + recordings save to Meetings. v1.17.2

v1.17.1  (2026-07-13)
    Meeting/Record: add 'Also capture the screen' — records desktop video (ffmpeg gdigrab) + system audio, muxes to MP4, and transcribes. Turns it into a full Zoom/Meet/webinar recorder, not just audio. Bundles ffmpeg via imageio-ffmpeg. v1.17.1

v1.17.0  (2026-07-13)
    New Meeting/Record tab: capture system audio (+ optional mic) and transcribe locally - works for calls, webinars, and any playing video incl. Skool (no URL). Adds AI 'Summarize' + save. Sidebar reordered: General, then services A-Z (incl. Meeting), then History/Stats, then License/Help/Feedback/About. v1.17.0

v1.16.17  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber layout: put Keep audio / Keep video checkboxes and Find in transcript on one row (fills the empty right side). v1.16.17

v1.16.16  (2026-07-13)
    Keep video file: now downloads the video FIRST (before the long transcription) so the signed Skool link is still valid, with visible status and a saved-file note. Uses a mergeless 'best' format so it works without extra ffmpeg steps. v1.16.16

v1.16.15  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber: optional 'Name this transcript' box. Leave blank for the video's own title; type a name and the transcript (and any kept audio/video) saves under it automatically - ideal for Skool videos that have no title. v1.16.15

v1.16.14  (2026-07-13)
    Transcriber: add 'Keep audio file' and 'Keep video file' checkboxes (default OFF). Keeps the downloaded audio and/or downloads the full video into the transcripts folder, with Skool Referer + browser-cookies support. v1.16.14

v1.16.13  (2026-07-13)
    Skool support: auto-add Referer/Origin for skool.com and .m3u8 (signed HLS), plus optional 'Sign in via browser' (yt-dlp cookies-from-browser) for member-only videos. Settings > Transcription dropdown + help text. v1.16.13

v1.16.12  (2026-07-13)
    Update install now runs the installer via a hidden waiter that starts only AFTER EchoQuill has fully exited - fixes the green banner 'close all instances' / app-not-closing race. Fixes both the banner and the About button routes. v1.16.12

v1.16.11  (2026-07-13)
    Recent transcriptions: drop the static caption line, add a hover '?' help next to the title (consistent with the other windows). Real per-icon tooltips remain. v1.16.11

v1.16.10  (2026-07-13)
    Fix tooltips not showing inside scrolling lists (ignore the spurious mouse-leave when the tip window maps; delayed cursor-anchored tooltip). Add tooltips across all windows: transcriber, batch, Ask AI, recent-transcriptions paging/tabs/delete, clips tabs/close. v1.16.10

v1.16.9  (2026-07-13)
    Recent transcriptions now works like the Clips tray: per-row star/edit/delete icons, a Recent/Favorites tab (Favorite pulls up only favorites), real search box with placeholder, tooltips. Clips search bar redone the same way (placeholder, no bare emoji) + row tooltips. v1.16.9

v1.16.8  (2026-07-12)
    Editor: clean layout (Save/Cancel + Ask AI never overlap), the AI instruction is now an obvious bordered field with placeholder, visible status feedback, and a tooltip. Tooltips + clear hints on all Ask AI buttons. v1.16.8

v1.16.7  (2026-07-12)
    Fix update install loop: hard-exit on update (frees single-instance mutex + file locks instantly), relaunched copy waits out the stale lock, exit immediately when installer launches. v1.16.7

v1.16.6  (2026-07-12)
    Favorite is now a real toggle (click again to un-favorite). Help '?' is a hover tooltip next to the title (no click, no 'New here?'). v1.16.6

v1.16.5  (2026-07-12)
    Edit dialog: Save always visible, opens beside the tray, + Ask AI (rewrite/reformat/answer in place). Remove ping watchdog window; installer relaunches silently. v1.16.5

v1.16.4  (2026-07-12)
    In-app update banner + Install button in Settings; auto-check on every open; drop floating desktop badge. v1.16.4

v1.16.3  (2026-07-12)
    Recent transcriptions: fit buttons, double/right-click edit, right-click menu, ★ favorites. v1.16.3

v1.16.2  (2026-07-12)
    Edit on the visible top toolbar (with page count); edit clips directly in the tray (✎)

v1.16.1  (2026-07-12)
    Edit button moved to left of the transcriptions bar so it's never clipped off-screen; wider window

v1.16.0  (2026-07-12)
    '?' help icon on the Clips tray and Transcriber windows with how-to (click/drag to paste, admin-rights note)

v1.15.0  (2026-07-12)
    auto update-check twice daily + green corner badge (hover to see version, click to update)

v1.14.2  (2026-07-12)
    edit transcription text and save it (Recent transcriptions → Edit)

v1.14.1  (2026-07-09)
    v1.14.1 CRITICAL: API key now persists across updates — load() resolves the Credential Manager vault (was returning a marker string, causing 401); bundle keyring Windows backend

v1.14.0  (2026-07-09)
    light/dark/system theme + optional audio recording history (budget + zip export)

    clearer checkbox label 'Format dictation with AI'

v1.13.15  (2026-07-06)
    current model lineup (GLM-5.2, DeepSeek-V4, Qwen3.5, GPT-5.4, Claude, Gemini-3-flash) with thinking labels, fast defaults, timeout back to 20; AI stays optional for dictation

v1.13.14  (2026-07-06)
    AI enhancement fails fast (6s) so a misconfigured provider can't stall dictation
